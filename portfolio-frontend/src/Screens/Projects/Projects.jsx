This project is not the most technical and was very easy to set up but I am adding it here as it is a reminder of where I started. It also gives people more of an idea of who I am. I love the portuguese language and have always strived to become fluent. Its a language outside of coding that I still study to this day. Both of my parents speak portuguese and it is my dads mother tounge. If you would like to like to see more of the webite, feel free to clone the repo. Check out the README for further information',
